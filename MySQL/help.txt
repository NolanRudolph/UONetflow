-= Running mysql as a server on port 3306 (default) =-

systemctl start mysqld
systemctl enable mysqld


-= Importing data to MySQL =-

mysql -u root -ppassword < tableToCreate.sql
mysqlimport -u root -ppassword --local --fields-terminated-by=, database fileThatIsAlsoTheNameOfTheSpecefiedTable

* Note: You'll receive a skepticism inducing number of warnings. This is simply because a lot of the fields could be int or float, however I have made some of them varchar to allow as a metric column for Grafana (i.e. IP Protocol Number or Source Port)

If you receive "mysqlimport: Error: 1148, The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version, when using table: [TABLE]", login to your mysql server and type: SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;


-= Finding Windows for Grafana =-

1. Find Epoch Windows
mysql> select startTime from [TABLE] LIMIT I1;  # This will be the start time
mysql> select startTime from [TABLE] ORDER BY startTime DESC LIMIT 1;

2. Find Regular Windows of Epoch Format
Grab both of those epoch times and throw it into https://www.epochconverter.com/timezones?q=1526287199.23&tz=America%2FLos_Angeles

3. Configure Grafana to display within this time period
* Note: If you have multiple graphs in different time frames, UTILIZE TIME SHIFT. The time shift pushes forward, implying a timeshift application to graphs made prior to future timestamps.
