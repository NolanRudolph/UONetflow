WELCOME TO MY PROJECT!  
  
The purpose of this particular project is to do 3 things:  
  
1. Create a means of converting netflow data from the University of Oregon to packets.  
  
2. Visualize this data in a variety of means.  
  
3. Allow a user to add data to the set as to emulate DoS attacks and other networking challenges.  
  
You can't find any of the UONetflow data here, however you could easily adjust my python code to your particular netflow!
